## Flow for Bounty Hunters

- **Step 1: Pick a bounty**
  - Look through [all of the available bounties](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/tree/main/bounties) in the `/bounties` directory in this repo. They are divided into 3 difficulty levels so chose the one which feels appropriate to your skill, level of involvement and the earning potential that excites you. 
  - Be sure and read all the bounty instructions and details carefully though as not all bounties are created and structured equally. Some are always available to claim, others are capped or may only accept 1 entry as viable for payout, so plan accordingly.
  - You can [look through the issues](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/issues) tab to discover which bounties are being worked on by whom. Who knows, maybe you could team up with someone and solve a bounty together!

- **Step 2: Open a new issue**
  - Once you've chosen a bounty your next task is to "claim" it by opening a new issue. 
  - Note the naming of your issue is important here. Misname and your bounty will not be considered for reward. Bounty issues can exist in 3 states, all demarcated by a prefixed color coded emoji, [ðŸ”µ&nbsp;, ðŸŸ¢&nbsp;, ðŸŸ£&nbsp;].
    - ðŸ”µ&nbsp; You have claimed and begun work on the bounty. You are actively making progress and should comment in the issue with any progress or details for reviewers.
    - ðŸŸ¢&nbsp; You have finished the bounty and are ready to begin the review process. Reviewers will now begin to review your work and assess it's level of completeness. From here more work may be requested to finish the bounty or your work may be rejected if you're really off target.
    - ðŸŸ£&nbsp; The review is complete and it's time for payout. Once the review is complete you're free to change the title status and await payment for a job well done!
    
    So to claim a bounty begin your issue title with a ðŸ”µ&nbsp; followed by the slug of the bounty. You are strongly encouraged to search for other similiar issues before beginning work to ensure you're not about to compete for a bounty which already has a max number of claimants. If that's the case though feel free to explore any open issues and offer assistance where it's needed. Team bounties often do better than solos.
