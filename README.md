## Flow for Bounty Hunters

Ready to start claiming bounties and earning rewards? Here's how.

- **Step 1: Pick a bounty**
  - Look through [all of the available bounties](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/tree/main/bounties) in the `/bounties` directory in this repo. They are divided into 3 difficulty levels so chose the one which feels appropriate to your skill, level of involvement and the earning potential that excites you. 
  - Be sure and read all the bounty instructions and details carefully though as not all bounties are created and structured equally. Some are always available to claim, others are capped or may only accept 1 entry as viable for payout, so plan accordingly.
  - You can [look through the issues](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/issues) tab to discover which bounties are being worked on by whom. Who knows, maybe you could team up with someone and solve a bounty together!

- **Step 2: Open a new issue**
  - Once you've chosen a bounty your next task is to "claim" it by opening a new issue. 
  - Note the naming of your issue is important here. Misname and your bounty will not be considered for reward. Bounty issues can exist in 3 states, all demarcated by a prefixed color coded emoji, [ðŸ”µ&nbsp;, ðŸŸ¢&nbsp;, ðŸŸ£&nbsp;].
    - ðŸ”µ&nbsp; You have claimed and begun work on the bounty. You are actively making progress and should comment in the issue with any progress or details for reviewers.
    - ðŸŸ¢&nbsp; You have finished the bounty and are ready to begin the review process. Reviewers will now begin to review your work and assess it's level of completeness. From here more work may be requested to finish the bounty or your work may be rejected if you're really off target.
    - ðŸŸ£&nbsp; The review is complete and it's time for payout. Once the review is complete you're free to change the title status and await payment for a job well done!
    
    So to claim a bounty begin your issue title with a ðŸ”µ&nbsp; followed by the slug of the bounty. You are strongly encouraged to search for other similiar issues before beginning work to ensure you're not about to compete for a bounty which already has a max number of claimants. If that's the case though feel free to explore any open issues and offer assistance where it's needed. Team bounties often do better than solos.

- **Step 3: Work on your bounty**
  - The next step is obvious, do the work! Please ensure you stick closely to the bounty scope, guidelines and details as laid out in the scope doc. Do your work excellently and you stand a great chance of claiming the reward.
  - Be sure and post progress occasionally on your bounty issue in order to catch any potential issues as early as possible and to confirm you're still working and progressing on the bounty.

- **Step 4: Have your bounty reviewed**
  - Once you've completed the bounty sufficiently and believe yourself to be completed you should change the emoji prefix on the issue title from a ðŸ”µ&nbsp; to a ðŸŸ¢&nbsp; to denote your bounty is ready for review.
  - Feel free to continue to work on your bounty but try and be responsive once reviewers begin commenting on your bounty. Prioritize their comments as their goal is to see that the bounty terms are met.

- **Step 4: Claim your reward**
  - Once the review has concluded your bounty will either be resolved as ineligible (unlikely but possible in the case of a weak attempt or ineligible duplicate bounty claims) or ready for payout. 
  - If the latter you should adjust the title for your bounty with a ðŸŸ£&nbsp; prefix so we can ensure a timely reward payout.

## Flow for Bounty Reviewers

Ready to review bounties and claim credit tokens for your expertise? Here's how.

- **Step 1: Choose a bounty**
  - Look through [all of the available bounties](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/issues) in the `Issues` tab in this repo. They are divided into 3 difficulty levels so chose ones which feel appropriate to your skill, level of involvement and the earning potential that excites you. 
  - Be sure and read all bounty instructions and details carefully as it's your job to ensure bounties are sufficiently meeting the criteria for the reward payout. You can only do that best when you are familiar with the bounty goals and objectives yourself.
  
- **Step 2: Review the bounty**
  - Clone the repo, pull the PR, test the solution, click the buttons, interact with the interface. It's your job to test and ensure the provided solution for the bounty actually meets the requirements. Leave comments, ask questions, be kind.
  - You have two courses of action on every bounty you review. Most commonly you will review, comment, resolve and discuss until the bounty is complete and you give it your stamp of approval for payout. In rare cases however a bounty may not have put in sufficient effort and you should mark it for tossing. In that case neither the hunter nor the reviewer will be rewarded so be slow to mark a bounty for the trash.

- **Step 3: Claim your reward**
  - Once you've marked a bounty as complete or for the trash your job is done until the payout is made to both the hunter and you. Your payout is slightly different in that it's in the form of a custom credit token which can be redeemed at any time for USDC (or any other asset DEX for that matter via path payments).
