## Description

### What is this task?

When building websites ontop of Stellar, there needs to be a way to access a user's Stellar account. This is where web-wallets like [Albedo](https://albedo.link/), [Rabet](https://rabet.io/) and [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) come in. They allow websites to easily and securely acces your Stellar account.

Your task is to build a simple website which allows you to sign in using a web-wallet like Albedo, Freighter or Rabet.

The website should show some basic information about the account currently logged in:
 * The account's assets and their balances should be shown.
 * The date when the account was created should be shown.
 * The account who created this account should be shown.
 
### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?
* The hunter should be able to build simple websites with Javascript.

### What are the deliverables?
#### Description
  - The hunter should provide a link to the repository containing the solution.

#### Review Criteria
  - As long as all features are present and correctly implemented, the submission should be accepted.
