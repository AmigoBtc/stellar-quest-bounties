## Description

### What is this task?

People using Stellar Laboratory on mobile devices do not have a very good user experience. Layout is scaled to fit the whole screen, along with text size, which makes it difficult for users to interact with the lab.

With majority of global traffic being on mobile ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/)), this possibly hinders adoption of Stellar network to mobile users.
