## Description

### What is this task?

People using Stellar Laboratory can only use Ledger, Trezor and Freighter to sign transactions. Unfortunately, these options only work with desktop computers. With majority of global traffic being on mobile ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/)), this possibly hinders adoption of Stellar network to mobile users.
