# Level 2 Bounties

Higher value bounties with a greater difficulty curve. The tasks are reserved for those a cut above the rest. These are often one and done bounties so be sure and check to see if others are already working, maybe you can team up!

Reward range trends between $100 and $500 for hunters and 5 - 10 credits for reviewers.
